Assignment Instructions

This is a Assignment 1. For details see "Assignments" under "Resources". 

Note: Please send in your code as a single .m file (unzipped). You can assume the code is run in the same directory that contains the data file.

Due date for code creation is Saturday at 11:55 pm. Please make sure to note this in your calendars. Code cannot be accepted late under any circumstances. The peer review of the code is due on the following Monday - same thing. No late assignments.   

Please judge the code you receive by the following grading criteria:

Review criteria: Assess on a 10 point scale. This has 2 component scores: 1) Does the code do what it is supposed to? 2) How good is the code itself?

Each component a possible maximum score of 5. For "does the code work", 5 is "works perfectly, does everything it is supposed to be doing and none of what it is not supposed to be doing", 4 is "works mostly, does almost everything that it is supposed to be doing", 3 is "sort of works", 2 is "mostly doesn't work", 1 is "barely works" and 0 is "doesn't work.

For "how nice is the code", 5 is "great code. Nicely organized, nicely commented, no notable inefficiencies or weirdness, elegant", 4 is "solid code. Gets the job done, is well organized and commented, but not especially commendable", 3 is "ok code. More or less stands for itself, but not particularly commendable", 2 is "poor code. Hard to figure out what is going on. Convoluted, inefficient, easy to break, hard to maintain". 1 is "unacceptable code. Total spaghetti code. Huge mess. Indecipherable.". 0 is "no code".

Use your best judgment on this qualitative scale. A key component of this is so that you can see how someone else solved the same problem. The TA will also review the code. 

Also - and importantly - do not sign your code (in the header). Generally speaking, get in the habit of doing that, but not for this. We want double-blind code review (the reviewers not knowing who they are reviewing and the people being reviewed not knowing who is reviewing them). 

Good luck
